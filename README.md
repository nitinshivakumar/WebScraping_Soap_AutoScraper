# Webscraping using AutoScraper and BeautifulSoup

## Objective:
The objective of this project is to collect data about top universities from a website using web scraping techniques. The project utilizes the AutoScraper library for automated data extraction and the BeautifulSoup library for parsing and further processing the collected data.

## Tools and Libraries Used:

Python: The programming language used for the project.
AutoScraper: A Python library for automated web scraping that allows the creation of scraping rules using a simple and intuitive syntax.
BeautifulSoup: A popular Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents, used for additional data processing and manipulation.
Project Steps:

## Website Selection:
Choose a website that provides information about top universities, such as rankings, names, locations, and other relevant data.
Install Required Libraries:
Install the necessary libraries, such as AutoScraper and BeautifulSoup, using appropriate package managers (e.g., pip).
Initial Data Scraping:
Use AutoScraper to create scraping rules to extract information like university names, rankings, and locations from the selected website.
Test the scraper on a sample page to ensure that it retrieves the desired data accurately.
Data Parsing and Cleaning:
Use BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content of the scraped page.
Perform additional data cleaning and formatting as needed to ensure accurate and consistent results.
Iterative Refinement:
Fine-tune the AutoScraper rules and BeautifulSoup parsing as necessary to handle variations in the website's structure or layout.
Test the scraper on multiple pages to ensure robustness and reliability.
Data Storage:
Store the collected data in a structured format, such as a CSV file, a database, or any other suitable storage solution.
